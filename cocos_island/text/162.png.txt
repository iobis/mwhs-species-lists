5. To strengthen research on fauna and vegetation on the Island, both terrestrial and
marine

Activities:

a. To organize a workshop with experts on the biota of the Island to design a 10 year long
research program

b. To complete a quantitative inventory of the flora .

c. To prepare a vegetation map indicating communities and vegetable associations

d. To prepare a sensitivity and risk map on the island considering aspects such flora and fauna

e. To establish at least 25 permanent parcels in different environments of the Island (before and
after the elimination of pigs). To establish at least 20 exclusion parcels, of 10 x 10 mts, to
study the effect of pigs on the vegetation.

f. To study at least 20 parcels in altered and non-altered forests to evaluate the effect of the pigs
on the original vegetation. This will additionally permit to foresee the effect that would be
produced upon the elimination of pigs.

g. To study the succession in communities altered by human activity

>

. To promote the systematic collection of algae
i. To carry out an evaluation by habitats of the bentonic flora on the Island
j. To carry out a biogeographic analysis of the bentonic flora on the Island
k. To evaluate the importance of the communities of algae on higher tropic levels and on the
stability of the coral reefs
6. To install a climatological, oceanographic and telemetric station
Activity:
a. Install adequate instruments to measure parameters such as precipitation, air and soil

temperature, evaporation, direction and speed of winds, relative humidity, solar radiation,
