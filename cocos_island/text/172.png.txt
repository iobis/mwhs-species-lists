C. WILDLIFE RECOVERY ZONE

Although the objective of the Park is the absolute protection, in the context of eradication of
the introduced species, it is necessary to define a recovery zone, that at the same time would
cover the entire Island. In this zone, the especial manipulation of the environment is permitted to
favor the recovery of certain flora and fauna species. Activities, like: fencing the nesting sites to
avoid depredation or disturbances from visitors, cutting off lianas to let the trees grow, and
draining the lagoons are permitted.

Based on the characteristics of the species and the environmental conditions access to the
public is allowed for instance, to extended areas of secondary growth. The so-called "potrero de
Gissler, ascending from Chatham to Wafer, and Punta Presidio are good examples of this
condition. In these areas it is recommended to reintroduce "Palo de Hierro", with protective cut
out surroundings to protect them from gramineous invasion.

D. BUFFER ZONE

The strip of 7.2 km, between the absolute protection ring (15 km) and the limit of 22.2 km
that constitutes the Territorial sea mark, is considered the buffer zone for the Park (Figure 3).
Conversely to what occurs in the majority of continental areas, where the buffer zones are
difficult to manage because they are surrounded by private property, in this case it is an area over
which the State has sovereignty. More so under the jurisdictional mandate dictated by the
"Constitutional Court", specially in matters that deal with the protection of the natural wealth.

It is proposed that within this buffer area, the only type of extraction permitted be that of
fishing resources using line or string."
