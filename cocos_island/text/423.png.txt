climate/currents/birds/nutrients/etc. that make up the CINP. The site thus meets criterion (ii) and the
related Conditions of Integrity.

Criterion (iv)

CINP also meets criterion (iv) for the critical habitat it provides for marine species and for the role it
plays as the major site in the region in protection of large pelagic species especially sharks. The
condition of integrity that requires protection of migratory species outside of CINP, however, is
impossible to achieve as these species are heavily exploited outside the park.

The marine biodiversity was the key component of inscription in 1997 and it was noted then that those
main values extend naturally beyond the boundaries of the World Heritage site. IUCN, therefore, fully
supports the extension of the boundaries to 22km and congratulates the efforts by the State Party to
protect the natural values of this site.

RECOMMENDATION
IUCN recommends that Cocos Island National Park World Heritage site is extended to 22km (12
nautical miles) to be commensurate with the new boundaries of the marine protected area.
