History of preservation/conservation

In the past, the essence of Cocos conservation was its isolation. With the exception of
* the.rare and unsuccessful attempts already mentioned aimed at populating the island,
Cocos ‘has mostly remained free from human influence. This allowed it to reach the .
second half of the XXth Century in an almost natural state.

Formal conservation of the island began ix in 1978, when it was declared a National Park.
From then on, a series of laws ‘and executive decrees were issued to reinforce its sfatus
(see Juridical Data and Annex 1). : : :

~ Both the terrestrial and marine areas guarantee the safekeeping ‘of the biodiversity
contained within its boundaries. Moreover, with the.. approval of the General -
Management Plan (1995) and the establishment of the island as a Conservation Area,
the-maritime limits were extended: a buffer zone of 7.2 km was added.to the 15 km
already protected. That adds up to 22:2 km (12 miles), the equivalent to the territorial
sea. This latest effort stresses the prominence given to the coastal and marine-pelagic
ecosystems: of this Conservation Area.
