TI. RESEARCH PROGRAM
The ignorance of many of the unique elements of the Island justifies the priority to
research projects. To this extern, the Park is particularly attractive due to the distinctive
characteristics of the islands: many endemic species, low diversity, and reduced populations
very sensitive to external agents.

On the other hand, the presence of feral pigs on the Island is specially sensitive element,
not only because of their impact but also because of their management or possible eradication.

Taken into account what has been mentioned above and with the purpose of effectively
monitoring the impact that tourism may be causing on the different environments it is
proposed:

Action guidelines
Define research priorities

Activity:

a. Appoint an advising scientific body, ad honorem, to revise proposals for research in the
area, to establish priorities and to grant approvals to collect organisms
2. To monitor terrestrial environments
Activities:
a. To study the flow of visitors per path
b. To seasonally analyze the conditions of the paths and the associated flora and fauna to
determine if the visitation impact remains stable, grows or decreases, and to make the

necessary corrections

c. To carry out comparative studies on distribution and abundance of flora and fauna (land) in
areas of public use

3. Monitoring of marine habits
Activities:

a. Choose representative sites to start a monitoring program
