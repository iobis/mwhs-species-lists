already determined. Specially conceming the lack of Public Use Guidelines? and the
protection of the insular platform. Most importantly, it is proposed to prepare a Plan of
Terrestrial and Marine Surveillance. The following guidelines go point in that direction:

Guidelines. Disseminate this information among visitors and transporting companies

c. Demand from the companies that offer diving tours and from other tourist operators to
include a copy of the Guidelines, in the information made available to potential customers

d. Evaluate monthly the results of the surveillance activities

e. Prepare a strategy to solve the problems identified through surveillance

2. To protect the insular platform
Activities:

a. Maintain the buffer zone (15 kms around the coast). Carry out a study to determine the
biomass of the most abundant species. Once the results are available, re-evaluate the
intensity of fishing in the area

b. Disseminate this information among fishermen

c. Coordinate with the surveillance radar systems of the EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)

d. Coordinate with air surveillance
