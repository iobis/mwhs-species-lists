2. Advise the Instituto de Pesca to organize at the national level, an information system
on water currents and temperature, accumulation of phytoplankton and tuna shoals.
Capture activities will be in this way made much easier at the Pacific of Costa Rica.

Activities:

a. Estimate the abundance of tuna and pelagic species, as well as the possibilities to
involve the advanced artisanal fleet in their capture.

b. Identify the training and technical assistance needs fishing systems to efficiently use
the mentioned resources.

c. Consolidate a communication system satellite-Earth station-craft so that the
information from the satellite can be interpreted by an Earth station, processed (most
probable cardumen location) and transmitted to the fishing boats.

d. Evaluate the commercialization potential in international markets of fresh tuna and
other pelagic species

e. Determine the needs and economic feasibility for the placement of a mother ship
nearby the Island

f Establish the necessary quality control systems to achieve quality standards in
international markets.

3. Coordinate, together with the Instituto de la Pesca, programs to awake
fishermen's awareness on the importance of the sustainable use of the marine
resources

Activities:
a. Identify in the fishing communities leaders coming from different social strata

b. Organize a workshop with the identified leaders and conservation groups in order to
know the situation deriving from a reduction of the fishing resources

c. Propose the mechanisms to achieve a horizontal coordination among interest
groups, conservations groups, economic and regional planning authorities,
representatives from the education sector and other community groups, with the
purpose to reconcile the different groups that contribute to the sustainable
exploitation of marine resources
