A, SUBPROGRAM OF ADMINISTRATION

planning activity.

The Rapid Ecological Survey led to the conclusion that certain basic administrative
elements are missing if we are to ascertain the good functioning of CINP. Thus, certain
activities which at first sight may seem obvious but that are necessary to set the basis of a
coherent planning process are recommended. Considering the administrative structure of the
state, the development of this type of processes may take years.

The general objective of this Program is to guarantee the execution of this GMP. Thus, it
must coordinate the implementation of the programs and subprograms of the area.
