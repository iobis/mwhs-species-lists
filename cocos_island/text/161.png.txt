d. Define a monitoring protocol according to international standards
e. Acquire equipment and financing to implement monitoring

f Train personnel for monitoring actions

g. Start, as soon as possible long term monitoring

h. Establish a simple follow-up system to determine if these areas are effectively recovering from
some natural disturbance (if such is the case) or decide if their status of absolute protection
should be lifted

4. To keep a biophysical, marine, and terrestrial inventory
Activity:
a. Define the procedure to carry out the Inventory of marine and terrestrial biodiversity

b. Identify threatened marine-coastal species that have economic importance
- prepare a list of threatened marine-coastal species
- Coordinate efforts with universities, UICN and INBio to generate a research proposal on
marine-coastal resources
- Carry out management studies on threatened species
- Carry out studies on the populations of key species (hammer head, white tip shark, and
"pez Angel Rey", among others) as well as the quantity and distribution of cleaning stations
in the most visited smaller islands (Manuelita, Roca Sumergida, Roca Bote, Aleta de
Tiburon, Dos Amigos, Punta Ulloa) with the purpose of establishing their value as ecological
indicators of impact by visitation

c. Determine the density of the wild fauna (with the purpose of providing a follow-up to the
condition of the populations

d. Coordinate with the ICT, MIRENEM, IGN, and the University of Costa Rica, through the
project PROAMBIL the preparation and publication of an atlas. A complete investigation on the
biophysical, marine, insular and climatic aspects must be made.
