D. SUBPROGRAM OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AND OUTREACH

A proposal for the Island to be considered Humanity Patrimony was rejected.
However, it is the opinion of the Island staff and the consulting team (UCR-FUNDEVI-
PROAMBD that the initiative must continue.

Equally important is to spread the unique value of the Island, and to promote awareness
among fishermen and general public on the need to protect its resources. This Subprogram
attempts, in addition, to face the fishing situation that affects the Island.
