4. State of preservation/conservation re
a. Diagnosis .

The CIMTCA holds both terrestrial and’t marine ecosystems that are unique in nature
and have been maintained in a very healthy state of conservation. Indeed, marine
ecosystems, which are the’ most prominent in this Conservation Area, are considered by
many as some of the few remaining pristine sites for Protection of large pelagics. '

Cocos island - and its surrounding oceanic area remain largely undisturbed ° “and
- modification of the area’s ecosystems has been minimal. Since the unsuccessful.
colonization attempts of the XIXth Century, the island has remained uninhabited and has.
only harbored occasional visits from whalers and treasure hunters. After the creation of ”
‘the National Park, strict management regulations forbid any kind of commercial
‘extraction of wildlife species, allowing for the preservation and even the rehabilitation of. ,
_ the local populations. _
