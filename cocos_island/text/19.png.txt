5. Justification far inclusion on the World Heritage List”

’ Without taking into consideration its spectacular scenic beauty and the historical value of -
, popular * legends surrounding the area, the. Cocos Island Marine and Terrestrial —
. Conservation Area is of international importance and should be’ consider for inclusion *
within the World d Heritage List of Natural Properties because: .

~  CIMICA is one of the rare. quasi pristine marine -environments :
where thé study of nafural processes in areas void of human
préssure i is still possible. :

» > The island acts as a distribution center for marine species in the
Eastern Pacific, beirig the first terrestrial constituent reached by
the North Equatorial Countercurrent affer covering a distance: of
‘more than 5000 km,- carrying water and organisms -from the ~
opposite side of the Pacific: This particular situation makes it a first
colonization point for larvae, which can later colonize other
aréas.

. » This Conservation Area presents invaluable opportunities for the:
: understanding of marine. biogeographic: trends, specially related
to the ldrge scale distribution of marine organisms. Ecological and
- evolutionary processes related to these trends are only beginning

* to be explored. .

» — CIMTCA: is believed to be one of the few places on earth where
~ the study of large, pelagics can take place under natural,
conditions. Thé reduced aggressiveness’ of sharks, ‘which. by itself
constitutes a unique example of global scale anima-habitat °°
interrelations, allows for short range-observations with an immense
_ Potential for ethnological studies. :
