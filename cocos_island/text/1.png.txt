STATE PARTY ("AUTHOR") COSTA RICA
CRITERIA ("KEY WORDS") _ N (ii)(iv)

DECISION OF THE WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE:

21* Session

The Committee inscribed Cocos Island National Park under natural criteria (ii) and (iv)
because of the critical habitats the site provides for marine wildlife including large pelagic
species, especially sharks. The Committee commended the Government of Costa Rica for its
initiative to incorporate the marine environment into the Park and encouraged it to extend
management from 8km to the 15km legal limit around the island.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

Cocos Island National Park, located 550 km off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica, is the only
island in the tropical eastern Pacific with a humid tropical forest. Its position as the first point
of contact with the northern equatorial counter current and the myriad of interactions between
the island and the surrounding marine ecosystem make the area an ideal laboratory for the
study of biological processes. The underwater world of the national park has become famous
due to the attraction it has for divers who rate it as one of the best places in the world to view
large pelagic species such as sharks, rays, tuna and dolphins.
