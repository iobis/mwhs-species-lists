Desctiption and inventory:

Cocos is an isolated Eastern Pacific Conservation Area, encompassing: the 24 ‘kn? Isla

* del Coco andthe surrounding 972.35 kin’ preserved marine ecosystems. In view of

_ their ecological importance, both land .and ocean have been placed under absolute

protection by the Costa Rican Government. The island remains uninhabited and human.

‘ disturbances have been minimat. .

This Conservation Area represents ‘a marine milestone in the large pelagic province of
the South Eastern Pacific, due mainly to the présence of unusually high congregations of
large pelagic species, numerous “cleaning stations”, importdnt coral reefs, abundant and .
diverse fish communities and high endemism. Recent-evidence also indicates tliat Cocos

holds an important role as "distribution center" for larvae of marine species coming °

- from as far as‘ the Indo-Pacific region (Guzman & Cortés 1992-1993; Grigg & Hey

1992).

From the terrestrial point of view, the area also. holds‘special significance. Cocos is the . .
only oceanic island in. Central’ America, and the.only one in the South Eastern Pacific

to support a wet tropical fauna and flora. Moreover, an exceptional feature is the :

presence of a pristine tropical cloud forest in the island's highlands,” the only such
ecosystem found i in an Eastern Pacific island (Hallingback et al. 1995). :
