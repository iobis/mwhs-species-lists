c. To maintain and to revise periodically the existence of first aid medication and equipment,
and to be sure that it contains the information related on the use, dosage, secondary effects,
and contraindications.

4. To improve the stability and conditions of the paths
Activities:

A- Path to Rio Genio's waterfall:
To close access 2

B- Gissler path:

1) To build a simple and rustic fence firm fence along the slope in zig-zag; to place 2 rest
areas along the initial slope. Two of the bends from where the landscapes can be better
appreciated”> could be used for this purpose.

2) To recondition the last 300m of this path”®.

3) To place trunks transversely (as stairs), and to build drainpipes in the sectors of
Gissler path's major slope, near Chatham bay.

C- Path to Cerro Iglesias

1) To concentrate repair works and maintenance on the first 2,5 kms (up to the first look
out), since the majority of the visitors return upon arriving to this point. It is important
to build a ditch for drainage along the path, especially on the steepest slopes.

2) At the look out: place a safety fence at the border, build a small rest area (benches and
drinking water) and place a sign indicating the altitude of the place.

3) Clearly define the way and eliminate improvised alternate paths at the beginning of
Cerro Iglesias

4) The steepest slopes of this path must be protected against the erosion by constructing
appropriate drainages

ror example coast irregularities, embarkations anchored in the bay,
the silhouette of the coral reefs

*6The sites where the path is made up of mussy flat stone are very
dangerous, since constitute a very unstable
surface. The first step would be the construction of a simple but firm
railing to lean on. In some places it would be better to build stairs.
