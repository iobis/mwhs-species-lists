5) Redefine the path's direction to avoid passing by the frigate ("fragata") nesting place located
about 1,5 km into the path

D- "Nuevo" path”

It has the ideal conditions to prepare an interpretative program for a self-guided walk
using a pamphlet: short distance, soft slopes and a great richness of flora and fauna. It is
important to find it an attractive name: "Esmeralda" (because of the color of the rocks in the
stream and alluding the real treasure of Coco's Island), "Palo de Hierro" (in reference to the most
common arboreal species), "Los Nidos” (because it ends up at an important nesting area for
marine species), etc.

1) Clearly mark the established route and provide the same with all along the stretch. Cut the
vegetation that may obstruct it for the first 75 mts, eliminate roots or branches that stick out
into the path

2) Cut the soil in small terraces or wide stairs at the steepest place (the one going up the slope
in a straight line), build a railing to serve as support and to prevent the user from getting out
of the established route

3) In the sectors just before and after the stream, where the undergrowth is low and thin,
proceed to mark the route to prevent multiple paths, either by eliminating the vegetation
(small ferns and herbal plants), or by using marks (color tape or arrows)

4) The last stretch of 75 mts before rc:.ching the terrace is a slope with unstable and bare soil
what may lead to taking different routes. Thus, it is indispensable to choose the most
adequate route (zig-zag ascent), mark it, make a leveled path, and as much as possible, to
place railings to prevent multiple paths. It is important to put signs indicating that the nesting
area is closely and that silence must be kept not to disturb the birds.

5) Build a small look out at the terrace, with benches and interpretative material. From here,
nests can be observed as well as a waterfall, the irregularities of the coast, sea birds, rocks
covered by moss and lichen, etc.

6) Before opening it to the public, it is necessary to build a return way, to guarantee the one
way direction

7) The Interpretative Program can be very rich, but it basically shows great potential to
explicitly highlight the true treasure of Cocoa’s Island (its biological richness)
