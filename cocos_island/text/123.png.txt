The achievement of the goals proposed in the GMP of the zone must depend on the
active participation of the area visitors and well as of those that manage the CINP. It is
important to understand and accept that an effective process of conservation cannot be
institutionalized. This must be a constant and dynamic activity among the involved parties,
with previously defined common goals and with a clearly structured methodology that reflects
the economic, social, political, and ecological reality of the PWA. To this extent, the NPS
plays an important role since its representatives are, who will actually execute the
recommendations of such GMP. .

If it is true that each wilderness area must have its own GMP, this does not guarantee
that it be implemented. In fact, and due to several reasons, few GMP are actually put into
practice as a whole. In our opinion, this is because many recommendations are made without
taking into account the existing infrastructure, the context, the financial aspects and the
administrative capacity for achieve them. For this reason, in order to provide the present
GMP with a more flexible structure, and with the purpose of facilitating the subsequent
preparation of the Annual Operational Plans, the following chart has been chosen:
