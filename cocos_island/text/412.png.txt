-Punta Presidio: richest area in coral species

-Bahia Iglesias: source of ramified coral for the rest of the Island
Fishing
-Semi-industrial and artesanal fishermen trespass the limits of the park
-Fish concentrate in a relatively small area which makes it sensitive to damage causes to
habitat from activities like diving and commercial fishing
Public Use
-Lack of general information about the Island (in site) such as maps, brochures and signs
-Scarce visitation control as well as destination points
-A better delimitation of anchoring sites is necessary
