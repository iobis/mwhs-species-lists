r Heavy precipitation (more than 7000 mm per year), the high rate

contributed to the appearance of a very diverse forest in a very

- small area. ot .

» One of the few --and the only one in the. South Eastern Pacific --
island cloud forest is found at Cocos,’ along with the ¢
corresponding: inhabitant, species. As -a relict of ‘this type of
habitat, recent studies have shown Cocos to be a natural area. of
occurrence of an otherwise endangered: species. [Calypogeia

rhynchophylia).

» Evidence of early speciation processes occurring in the island is
being studied at present for the Cocos finch, Mucuna urens and
Wendilgarda galapagensis: ,

' » Many of the species found in CIMTCA are endemic: 70 flowering
plants, 5 ferns, 65 insects, 35 mollusks, 20 fish, 5 arthropods, three .
land birds, two reptiles, one echinoid and one annelid. -

"This relatively high rate of. endeinism in a relatively pristine environment
provides extraordinary opportunity for evolutionary and ecological studies in
very constant environment of great rainfall and soil fertility. Land birds in .
particular show unusual adaptations, and behaviors that may. be of wide
interest"...:' Thomas Sherry. & Tracéy Werner, Dartmoth College, New.
