fragility of coral prone to physical or mechanical damage that could be caused by ankers,
vibration from powerful engines, or even an excessive direct contact with the divers. As coral
is a live substrate the effects would spread to fish and other organisms.

A level of considerable damage has not been reported as a by-product of tourism in any
site, perhaps because the number of divers is still low. In addition, divers usually are at a level
beyond basic, or are even more experienced and this reduces the risks of accidents. Likewise,
diving masters instruct visitors neither to touch the fish nor the substrate and carry out their
diving sessions under conditions of "neutral floatability’.

C. Batimetry

The insular platform of Coco's Island is very varied both in batimetric traits as well as in
extension (Fig. 1). The limits are perfectly defined by the isobata of 100 fathoms (183 mts), at
which point the depth gradient changes drastically. Its maximum extension is to the
Northwest, with a longitude of seven nautic miles.

GPS global measurements indicate some differences concerning the coordinates of the
DMA nautic chart No. 21621 prepared by the Defense Mapping Agency in Washington DC.

The data shows that the present chart shows a displacement of about 15 seconds of
latitude towards the south of the insert (scale 1:10,000) of Bahia Chatham. A displacement of
about 5 seconds longitude towards the east of the nautic chart was also found.

These differences in positioning, together with others found close to the coast around the
Island, suggest that the present nautic chart for Coco's Island, needs a new georeferencing.
