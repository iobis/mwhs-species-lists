# mwhs-species-lists

This is a collection of scripts for compiling species lists for marine World Heritage sites.

## Data preparation

### Cocos Island National Park

This script does not produce a definitive species list, but it tries to extract taxon names from the included pdf. The script first used OCR to generate a text file for each page, then a neural network model provided by [TaxoNERD](https://github.com/nleguillarme/taxonerd) is used to extract taxon names.

This script fetches all checklists from https://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/datazone/checklist.
